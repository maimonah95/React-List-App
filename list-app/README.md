 ##  Development process:

**Planning:** Create User story .

**Implement:** 
- Download the Requirements.
  * To create react app we need to Download packages and Tools using npm
    or Run packages without downloading using npx. 
     * (npx create-react-app  (app name)).
  * BrowserRouter is the router implementation for HTML5 browsers (vs Native). // Link is your replacement for anchor tags.
     * npm install react-router-dom

  *   axios is promise-based HTTP client that sports an easy-to-use API and can be used in both the browser and Node. js
      * npm install axios --save 
  * IoIconPack is utilizes ES6 imports that allows us to include icons
      * import IoIconPack from 'react-icons/lib/io'


**Testing:** 
Test Each function .

## unsolved problems:
Save the data to localStorage or an API.
